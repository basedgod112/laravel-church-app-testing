# Laravel Church App

A Laravel-based web application for church community management, featuring FAQs, programs, news, favorite Bible verses, friend requests, and contact messaging functionality.

## Project Overview

This application provides a comprehensive platform for church community members to:

-   Browse and manage FAQs and their categories
-   View church programs and events
-   Access church news updates
-   Save and manage favorite Bible verses
-   Send and receive friend requests
-   Submit contact messages to the church

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites

-   PHP 8.2 or higher
-   Composer
-   Node.js and npm
-   A database system (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laravel-church-app.git
    cd laravel-church-app
    ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Install JavaScript dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create environment configuration**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate application key**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Configure database**

    - The project is pre-configured to use SQLite (as used during development)
    - For SQLite: Ensure `database/database.sqlite` exists or create it with `touch database/database.sqlite`
    - For other databases: Update the `DB_CONNECTION` and related settings in your `.env` file
    - Configure your mail settings for the contact form functionality

7. **Run database migrations**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8. **Seed the database (optional)**

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

9. **Start the development server**

-   Using Herd (recommended on Windows):

    ```bash
    herd start
    ```

    If `herd` is not available on your `PATH`, you can run Artisan with Herd's bundled PHP as a fallback:

    ```bash
    "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Herd\\php\\php.exe" artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or the address reported by Herd).

10. **Build front-end assets**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    For production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## AI Usage

This project was developed with assistance from AI tools as follows:

-   **GitHub Copilot**: Used for development acceleration after initial code structure was established. Copilot was employed throughout the project to speed up development workflow. All generated code has been carefully reviewed, analyzed, verified for correctness, and understood before acceptance. Usage was distributed across the entire project as needed for various components and features.

-   **Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro)**: Used at the end of the project for styling and CSS to ensure a polished user interface.

## Optional Bible installation

The repository includes the full Bible as JSON files under `storage/app/bible/WEB` for the app to use. For convenience I provide a compressed archive `storage/app/bible/WEB.zip` that contains all 1000+ chapter files.
If you desire to have the Bible and related functionalities, you can unzip the file into the correct location.

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# Ensure the target directory exists, then extract WEB.zip into it
mkdir -Force "storage\app\bible\WEB"
Expand-Archive -Path "storage\app\bible\WEB.zip" -DestinationPath "storage\app\bible\WEB" -Force
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
# Ensure the target directory exists, then extract WEB.zip into it
mkdir -p storage/app/bible/WEB
unzip -o storage/app/bible/WEB.zip -d storage/app/bible/WEB
```
